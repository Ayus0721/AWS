#  AWS 
- AWS stands for Amazon Web Services.
- The AWS service is provided by the Amazon that uses distributed IT infrastructure to provide different IT
  resources available on demand. It provides different services such as infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS)

- Amazon launched AWS, a cloud computing platform to allow the different organizations to take advantage of reliable IT infrastructure


# What is Cloud Computing?
- It is the use of remote servers on the internet to store, manage and process data rather than a local 
   server or personal computer
# There are basically 3 categories in cloud computing

## Different domains in which AWS offer services:
- Compute:
 It is used to process data on the cloud by making use of powerful processors which serve multiple instances
at a time
- Storage and Content Delivery:
The storage as the name suggests, is used to store data in the cloud, this data can be stored anywhere but
content delivery on the other hand is used to cache data nearer to the user so as to provide low latency.
- Database:
  The database domain is used to provide reliable relational and non-relational database instances managed by AWS
- Networking:
  It includes services which provide a variety of networking features such as security, faster access etc
- Management Tools:
  It includes services which can be used to manage and monitor your AWS instances.
-  Security and Identity:
  It includes services for user authentication or limiting access to a certain set of audience on your AWS resources.

- Application Services: It includes simple services like notifications, emailing and queuing.

- ## 1. General Instances:

- For applications that require a balance of performance and cost.
- E.g email responding systems, where you need a prompt response as well as the it should be cost effective, since it doesn’t require much processing
  
-  ## 2. Compute Instances

- For applications that require a lot of processing from the CPU.
- E.g analysis of data from a stream of data, like Twitter stream

  
- ## 3. Memory Instances
  
- For applications that are heavy in nature, therefore, require a lot of RAM
- E.g when your system needs a lot of applications running in the background i.e
multitasking.

- ## 4. Storage Instances

- For applications that are huge in size or have a data set that occupies a lot of space.
- E.g When your application is of huge size

- ## 5. GPU Instances

- For applications that require some heavy graphics rendering
- E.g 3D modelling etc

# AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Elastic Beanstalk quickly deploy and manage applications in AWS without worrying about the underlying
infrastructure.

- Elastic Beanstalk is a service provided by AWS which is used for deploying infrastructure which consists of many AWS services
- These services include AWS S3, EC2, auto-scaling, cloud watch, Elastic load balancer, and simple notification service
- It is easy to start with Elastic Bean Stalk as you can see AWS Management Console, the command line interface or the API
- All you have to do is choose your platforms such as Node.js or Ruby and Amazon EC2 instance type.
- After the code is uploaded the AWS Elastic Beanstalk will handle the rest of the activities such as provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and other activities.
- AWS does not implement any extra charges for Elastic Beanstalk as you have pay only for the AWS
  resources needed to run your applications without any hidden or upfront cost

# AWS Elastic Load Balancing

![image](https://github.com/Ayus0721/AWS/assets/147092631/f176605c-1cae-41dd-b5b9-1a8db6b51b28)

- ELB automatically manages the workload on your instances and distributes them to other instances in case of an
  instance failure.

- # What is Load Balancer?
- Load Balancer is a virtual machine or appliance that balances your web application load that could be Http or
  Https traffic that you are getting in. It balances a load of multiple web servers so that no web server gets
  overwhelmed.
# Types of Load Balancer
  ![image](https://github.com/Ayus0721/AWS/assets/147092631/39081e8d-7ed8-4448-9cbc-f3025409c802)

- # Application Load Balancer
- An Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched a new load balancer known as an Application load balancer
  (ALB) on August 11, 2016.
- It is used to direct user traffic to the public AWS cloud.
- It identifies the incoming traffic and forwards it to the right resources. For example, if a URL has
  /API extensions, then it is routed to the appropriate application resources.
- It is operated at Layer 7 of the OSI Model.
- It is best suited for load balancing of HTTP and HTTPs traffic.
- Application load balancers are intelligent, sending specific requests to specific web servers
- If we take an example of TESLA. We have three models of TESLA, i.e., TESLA Model X, TESLA Model S, and TESLA Model 3 and TESLAs have onboard computing facility. You will have a group of web
  servers that serve the Model X, a group of web servers that serve the Model S, and similarly for Model 3.
  We have one Load balance that checks whether the incoming traffic comes from either Model X, Model S or Model 3, and then sends it to the intended froup of servers.

- # Network Load Balancer
- It is operated at the Layer 4 of the OSI model.
- It makes routing decisions at the transport layer (TCP/SSL), and it can handle millions of requests per
  second.
- When a load balancer receives a connection, it then selects a target from the target group by using a flow hash routing algorithm.
  It opens the TCP connection to the selected target of the port and forwards the request without modifying the headers.
- It is best suited for load balancing the TCP traffic when high performance is required.
- # Classic Load Balancer
- It is operated at Layer 4 of the OSI model.
- It routes the traffic between clients and backend servers based on IP address.
- For example, an Elastic Load balancer receives a request from a client on TCP port 80, it will then routes
  the request to a specified port of backend servers. The port on which the Load Balancer routes to the target
  server will be having port number 80. The backend server will then send the requested data back to the
  ELB, which will then forward the Backend server reply to the client. According to the client's perspective,
  the request has been fulfilled by the ELB, not by the backend server.
- Classic Load balancers are legacy Elastic load balancers.

- It can also be used for load balancing the HTTP or HTTPs traffic and use layer 7-specific features, such as
  X-forwarded and sticky sessions.
- You can also use the Layer 4 load balancing for applications that rely purely on the TCP protocol.

# AWS Lambda

- AWS Lambda is used to execute backend code without worrying about the underlying architecture, you just upload the code and it runs, it’s that simple!

- # What is AWS Lambda?

- Amazon explains, AWS Lambda (λ) as a ‘serverless’ compute service, meaning the developers, don’t have
  to worry about which AWS resources to launch, or how will they manage them, they just put the code on
  lambda and it runs, it’s that simple! It helps you to focus on core-competency i.e. App Building or the code.
- Lambda is used to encapsulate Data centres, Hardware, Assembly code/Protocols, high-level languages,
  operating systems, AWS APIs.
- Lambda is a compute service where you can upload your code and create the Lambda function.
- Lambda takes care of provisioning and managing the servers used to run the code.
- While using Lambda, you don't have to worry about scaling, patching, operating systems, etc.

- # Then why not EC2 ?

![image](https://github.com/Ayus0721/AWS/assets/147092631/28a8eb44-4e35-4cdd-a2c7-ed75a8773ec2)



- But, if your code will be running for hours, and you expect a continuous stream of requests, you should
  probably go with EC2, because the architecture of Lambda is for a sporadic kind of workload, wherein there
  will be some quiet hours and some spikes in the no. of requests as well.
- For example, logging the email activity for say a small company, would see more activity during the day
  than in the night, also there could be days when there are less emails to be processed, and sometimes the
  whole world could start emailing you! In both the cases, Lambda is at your service
- Considering this use case for a big social networking company, where the emails are never ending because
  it has a huge user base, Lambda may not be the apt choice.

- # AWS Autoscaling
- The Autoscaling feature is used to scale up and down automatically as and when required.
- The application available at AWS requires space and load and the Auto Scaling helps us by providing
  surety that there is a sufficient number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle that load.
- You can set a limit on EC2 instances such that the number doesn’t go below this.
- The maximum numbers of EC2 instances can be set to be on a safer side.
- AWS Autoscaling ensures that your group has a sufficient amount of servers.
- Auto-scaling automatically modifies the EC2 instance as per your demand changes.
- One can access Auto Scaling by signing into the AWS Management Console.
- AWS Auto-scaling helps you if you are using language-specific APIs rather than submitting requests over
  HTTP or HTTPS Auto Scaling provides a benefit of libraries, Sample code, tutorial, and other resources
  for the development of the software. 
- It also helps us with some functions such as retrying requests, and handling error responses, making it is
  easier for the applicant to get started.
