## Different domains in which AWS offer services:
- Compute: It is used to process data on the cloud by making use of powerful processors which serve multiple instances
at a time
- Storage and Content Delivery: The storage as the name suggests, is used to store data in the cloud, this data can be stored anywhere but
content delivery on the other hand is used to cache data nearer to the user so as to provide low latency.
